    <h3>Target 7.1: Ensure universal access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy services by 2030</h3>
    Global electrification has risen from 87% in 2015 to 91% in 2021. However, the pace of growth has slowed. Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and sub-Saharan Africa, remained without access to electricity in 2021.
    In 2021, 71% of the global population had access to clean cooking fuels, a rise from 64% in 2015. However, in seven countries in sub-Saharan Africa, less than 10% of the population had access. The widening access gap in this region might impede overall global progress.

    <h3>Target 7.2: Increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix by 2030</h3>
    Renewable energy comprised 19.1% of total final energy consumption in 2020, a 2.4 percentage point increase since 2015. This progress is primarily evident in the electricity sector, while limited advancements were seen in the heat and transport sectors.

    <h3>Target 7.3: Double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency by 2030</h3>
    The rate of improvement in primary energy intensity dropped to 0.6% in 2020, the lowest since the global financial crisis. A considerable shift towards more energy-intensive industrial production during the pandemic, coupled with modest technical efficiency enhancements, contributed to this slowdown.<!-- Include your analysis, findings, graphs, or content related to this component -->

  <div class="analysis-component">
    <h3>Target 7.A: Enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy research and technology</h3>
    Financial support for clean energy in developing nations saw a declining trend even before COVID-19, with a notable 11% drop in 2021 compared to 2020, significantly lower than the decade-long average from 2010 to 2019.

    <h3>Target 7.B: Expand infrastructure and upgrade technology for supplying modern and sustainable energy services for all</h3>
    While there was a record-breaking installation of renewable capacity in developing countries in 2021, with a growth rate of 9.8%, these positive trends do not place developing countries on track to achieve SDG 7 by 2030. Additionally, the most vulnerable countries are being left behind amidst global and regional progress.
